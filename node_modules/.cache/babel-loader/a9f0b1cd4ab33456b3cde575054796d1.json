One handy way to obtain it is to use ES6 `import * as`\n * syntax. You may also pass a single function.\n *\n * @param {Function} dispatch The `dispatch` function available on your Redux\n * store.\n *\n * @returns {Function|Object} The object mimicking the original object, but with\n * every action creator wrapped into the `dispatch` call. If you passed a\n * function as `actionCreators`, the return value will also be a single\n * function.\n */\n\n\nexport default function bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) {\n  if (typeof actionCreators === 'function') {\n    return bindActionCreator(actionCreators, dispatch);\n  }\n\n  if (typeof actionCreators !== 'object' || actionCreators === null) {\n    throw new Error('bindActionCreators expected an object or a function, instead received ' + (actionCreators === null ?
