# Holo Hosting App GUI
**Status:** Closed-Alpha. Early development and testing.

The hosting app is a space for Hosts and App Providers to interact

**App Providers** list their apps along with their hosting preferences. This makes the app available for hosting. It registers a domain name for the app and other stuff.

**Hosts** declare their intention to host an app and record their private signed service logs here. They can also compile invoices for their app Providers.

### Development
Run `npm start` to see your app at `localhost:4100`

### Building & Deploying
1.  Run `npm run build`, which will compile all the necessary files to the
    `build` folder.

2.  Upload the contents of the `build` folder to your web server's root folder.
